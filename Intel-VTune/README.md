# Intel VTune script

## How to run
copy **VTune_report_generator.sh** in your application directory and type the following commands:
```
chmod u+x ./VTune_report_generator.sh
./VTune_report_generator.sh ./your_appl
```

## What it produces
After execution of **VTune_report_generator.sh** you will have a new directory called **reports**. In this directory there are all the reports generated by VTune. The default collected information are the following:

#### Where application spends time
- hotspots
- memory-consumption 

#### Compute efficency of multi-thread
-  threading 
- hpc-performance

#### My application is explotiing underlying hardware
- uarch-exploration
- memory-access

If you want to change the information that will be collected go in the **VTune_report_generator.sh** file and change the arrat called *COLLECT_TYPE*:
```
declare -a COLLECT_TYPES=("hotspots" "memory-consumption" 
                          "threading" "hpc-performance"
                          "uarch-exploration" "memory-access"
                         )
```
